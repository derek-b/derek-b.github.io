# Entering the 21st Century

I have finally started a blog. Why now you may ask? There are a couple of reasons. Now 
that my youngest son is turning eight I have a little bit more extra time than when the 
kids were little. So, I'm trying to fill that time without about 4x more activities than 
will fit. The main reason is that after almost 20 years in the field of technology I have 
realized I actually do know a lot of stuff. So, I've started speaking at conferences, 
writing technical articles and now blogging.

So, what I be blogging about? Mostly programming, database design, security or 
accessibility. As much as I would like to keep this just on tech topics I have a feeling
 that in today's political climate that may eventually spill over into this blog as well.
